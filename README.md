This is a challenge for making this html code for this website more accessible.
There were a bunch of <div> that had things attached to them but I replaced them with things like footer, header, section, etc. 
This would help accessability especially if there were a blind person reading the website using a screen reader, making it more comprehensive and leading to a more inclusive web page.
I scored a 97 on lighthouse in accessability which is a big improvement from the 93 that the html code had before.

I also combined some sections in the CSS code just to get rid of repeating lines of code and instead combined those sections to make one that applied to multiple things. 

Also added comments in the html and CSS code.
